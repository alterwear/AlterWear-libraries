# AlterWear-libraries
Custom EPD libraries for controlling the eink displays from Pervasive Displays.

### Image manipulations
- **image_flip** - This flips the image on the horizontal access (long way) so text is displayed backwards. Can also cycle between patterns w only a single image file.


### TODO
- [ ] Collect timing info for a single line, and for various sized images (should be the same regardless of image size).
- [ ] See if changing the way line() is called from fixed_data_repeat speeds things up.
